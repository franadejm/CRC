# CRC

Implements a data structure CDynamicBitset which aims to mimic std::bitset but, as the name suggests, also have the capability to modify its capacity at runtime. This is used for creating a class that represents a binary polynomial, with all the expected arithmetic operations. Finally, the binary polynomials are used to implement a simple CRC coding scheme with a few industry standard generating polynomials.
